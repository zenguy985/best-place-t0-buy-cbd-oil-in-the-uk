A quick readme of the best place to buy cbd oil in the uk

# Are you look to buy CBD Oil in the uk?

Within the UK market there are now many strong options for buying CBD Oil. In your local area it's likely you have more than one Health shop to purchase CBD from. You could also use a large chain such has Holland and Barret who now stock their own version of CBD Oil.

Outside of the brick and mortar stores there are many, many online stores to buy CBD Oil from, and here is where we hope to help you.

# What are you looking for?

When buying online, straight away you need to check a few things

1.	Is the site secure – Check the site is HTTPS secure – make sure it has that little padlock in the URL bar. Anyone who is not HTTPS secure then remember to steer well clear.
2.	It is well reviewed, by this I mean check the Trustpilot score or reviews.com score. Make sure the site is publicly reviewed, a good example of this is [I'm an inline-style link](https://www.cbdshopy.co.uk)Cbdshopy, those guys have over 500 5-star reviews and this you know they can be trusted.

# Premium or Own Brand

Next you need to decide on brand product or own brand product. A good example of this Is Tesco, when shopping in Tesco you can buy premium brand chocolate (Nestle/Dairy Milk) or you can buy Tesco value chocolate. There are some companies who operate more on the M&S model, they sell premium brands but also their own brand is premium.

Some examples of premium brand CBD Oil is Trip CBD, a great example of premium own brand is CBDshopy own oil which can be found here.

Strength

Once you know if you are going premium or own brand you need to decide on your strength. Strength is usually measured in mg, for example 100mg, 300mg, 1000mg. Now CBD effects everyone differently so there is no hard and fast rule. In general though the advice is start on the lower end and move upwards, with most people settling on a 500mg oil or 1000mg oil.

Price

Finally, double check the price and ensure you are happy with it, you can check the price per mg, or compare price to others. Remember a lower price doesn’t always mean it’s the best option for you, also the highest price doesn’t necessarily mean it’s the best quality. The best advice I can give here is to do your research.

Lab reports

Now a point to consider when buying cbd oil is to ensure the cbd oil actually has the CBD in it, to verify this each site should publish the third-party lab reports for you to check. Please ensure to check these, if no lab reports than avoid buying as you don’t know what’s in the oil

Are you sure oil is for you

For some taking cbd oil orally can be an issue and thus people like to take CBD via things such as edibles. CBD gummies are becoming very popular in the UK with our favourite CBD gummies being zenbears. You can find them here.

Again cbdshopy has a great buying guide for cbd gummies over here.

So to recap

1.	Check HTTPS and reviews, no HTTPS then leave, no reviews then leave
2.	Decide if buying a brand or an own brand
3.	Choose your strength 
4.	Check and verify the price
5.	Verify the lab reports
6.	Decide between oil and gummies
7.	Purchase and enjoy your product
